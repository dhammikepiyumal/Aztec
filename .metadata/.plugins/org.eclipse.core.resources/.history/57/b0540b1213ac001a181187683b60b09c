/*
 * 'Canvas' can be called as a window which the programmer can manupulate in any
 * manner
 */
/*
 * 'Runnable' allows the Game class to be used as a thread process
 */
/*
 * 'width' and 'height' are the dimensions of the window.
 */
/*
 * 'scale' is the factor that the window is to be streatched
 */
/*
 * 'private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L' is added as the 'Game'
 * class extends the 'Canvas' class. It is some kind of a convenction in Java to
 * add it
 */
/*
 * A 'thread' can be called as sub process other than the main process of
 * running the program. Here it is used to keep the game process of running the
 * game seperated from the main process of executing the program
 */
/*
 * 'JFrame' is basically a type of Window. There are other types of Windows
 */
/*
 * 'Dimension' is a way of providing coordinates in java
 */
/*
 * 'running' is the condition that keeps the Game loop running
 */
/*
 * 'synchronized' is used to prevent the interferences between the threads and
 * to avoid memory consistency errors
 */
/*
 * 'thread = new Thread(this, "Display')' means passing this game class to
 * create a new thread object and provide it with the name 'Display'
 */
/*
 * 'thread.join()' is joining all the threads together to perform a certain task
 * applying the result for all of them. eg: Stop running all the threads to stop
 * the program running
 */
/*
 * 'e.printStackTrace()' is used to print the error message if a certain error
 * has encountered
 */
/*
 * 'add' is used to add the game component to the window
 */
/*
 * 'pack' is used to size up the frame to be the same size of the component
 */
/*
 * 'setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE)' is simply says terminate the
 * application when the close button on the top right conor of the window is
 * pressed
 */
/*
 * 'setLocationRealativeTo(null)' is making the window stay at the ceter of the
 * frame
 */
/*
 * 'setVisible(true)' is actually making the window visible on the screen to be
 * seen by the viewers
